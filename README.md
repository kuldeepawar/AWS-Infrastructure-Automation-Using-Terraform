# AWS-Infrastructure-Automation-Using-Terraform

### Problem Statement: AWS Infrastructure Automation Using Terraform
Background
The provided architecture represents a highly available, scalable, and secure AWS cloud infrastructure for hosting containerized applications. The infrastructure includes ECS (Elastic Container Service) clusters, an RDS PostgreSQL database, an Application Load Balancer (ALB), and a NAT gateway for outbound internet access from private subnets.

Challenges to Address
VPC and Networking Setup

Create a VPC (10.0.0.0/16) with public and private subnets distributed across two Availability Zones (us-west-1a and us-west-1b).

Deploy an Internet Gateway (IGW) for public subnet internet access.

Deploy a NAT Gateway in the public subnet to allow private instances to reach the internet securely.

Application Hosting Using ECS

Provision ECS clusters with EC2 launch type in private subnets.

Configure Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) to dynamically scale ECS tasks.

Define IAM roles and security groups for ECS instances.

Load Balancing and Traffic Management

Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in public subnets.

Set up target groups and listeners to route traffic to ECS tasks.

Implement security groups and access control to allow only necessary traffic.

Database Deployment (RDS PostgreSQL)

Deploy an RDS PostgreSQL instance in private subnets.

Set up database security groups to allow access only from ECS containers.

Enable automated backups, multi-AZ deployment, and monitoring.

Scalability and Security Best Practices

Use Terraform modules and variables to ensure reusability and flexibility.

Implement least privilege IAM policies for ECS, ALB, and RDS.

Enable logging and monitoring using AWS CloudWatch and VPC Flow Logs.

Expected Outcome
A Terraform-based AWS infrastructure that provisions a secure, scalable, and highly available environment for containerized applications. The deployment should support automated scaling, secure database access, and optimized networking configurations.
